# giftlist
### Create a list of gifts for a birthday, Christmas, baby shower, etc. that others can reserve so there won't be duplicate gifts.
Language: *JavaScript*<br />
Framework: *Express JS*<br />
Database: *MySQL*<br />

## Goal of the Project
My goal for this project was to learn Express and create a simple website within two weeks. It ended up taking 17 days, but still a success. There were some issues with opening multiple streams to the MySQL database... but if I decide to rebuild, the site would work much better as a standard HTML app with a serverless backend.

## Usage
The site is currently live and in use by a few people. You can [go here](https://www.onceuponawishlist.com/) to look at the site yourself (but you will have to create an account to do anything).
